AutoEvaNetBuilder - Evacuation Network Modeling and Simulation Tool

1. Introduction
AutoEvaNetBuilder is a standalone software tool designed to automatically generate evacuation topological networks from floor plan images and perform evacuation simulations with visualization. The tool processes input floor plans through a series of steps including semantic segmentation, morphological processing, path analysis, network modeling, and simulation.

​Note: This is a pre-packaged executable version - no Python installation required!

2. System Requirements
​Windows 10/11​ (64-bit)
​Minimum 2GB RAM​ (4GB recommended)
​500MB free disk space​
​FFmpeg​ (required for evacuation animation generation)

3. FFmpeg Installation (Required for Visualization)
The evacuation process animation generation requires ​FFmpeg. Please download FFmpeg from: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z
